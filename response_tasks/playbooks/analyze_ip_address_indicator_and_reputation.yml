workflow: "1. If Splunk present, run Splunk Query on each indictor and prevalence\
  \ in the environment. Summarize # of times indicator seen in the last 24 hrs, 7\
  \ days, 1 month, six months increments. Return the hosts that have used this indictor.\
  \ (make an artifact for each host?)\n  a. search -> ```| stats ...```\n1. Gather\
  \ repetitional, intelligence and general information regarding indicator into a\
  \ note (a note for each indicator)\n1. Perform any additional research regarding\
  \ indicators and understanding what normal behaviour is or should be by using using\
  \ search engines, knowledge bases etc.\n1. Make a determination of indicator, Known\
  \ APT, Commodity, Suspicious or Not Malicious and whether to tag to block indicator\n\
  \  a. This should align to a severity change (Known APT = High, Commodity = Med,\
  \ Suspicious = Low, Not Malicious = Info)\n  a. Change container and artifact severity\
  \ and tag artifact & indicator(s) with blocked and determination tag\n"
