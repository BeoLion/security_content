  if Phish, Spam, Suspicious or Clean ?

  Analyst should be reviewing SPF, DKIM, DMARC along with To: and Reply to: fields
  for non-matching data. Does the subject contain suspicious content. Is there a file
  or url? Does the x-origin-ip come from the same location and the sending domains?
  Does the email body seem too good to be true or create a sense of urgency?

  \ (make an artifact for each host?)\n  a. search -> ```| stats ...```\n1. Gather\
  \ reputation, intelligence and general information regarding indicator into a note\
  \ (a note for each indicator)\n1. Perform any additional research regarding indicators\
  \ and understanding what normal behaviour is or should be by using using search\
  \ engines, knowledge bases etc.\n1. Make a determination of indicator, Known APT,\
  \ Commodity, Suspicious or Not Malicious and whether to tag to block indicator\n\
  \  a. This should align to a severity change (Known APT = High, Commodity = Med,\
